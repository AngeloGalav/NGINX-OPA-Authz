# How to use the requester

As of right now, you can only use the bash requester to test simple `operation` and `role` combination.

```
./requester_test.sh [operation] [role]
```

JWT support for this debugger is on the way. 

For easier testing, just use the frontend at `https://pippocnaf.test.example:8081/`.
